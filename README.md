## NFTensor

NFT Smart Contract for the NFTensor NFTs.

#### Architecture

This contract must be deployed and the NFTensor api must be used in conjunction to generate and host the images.  
Once the 10 day minting period is over, the tokenURI will be updated to point to ipfs. The system is architected this way in order to reduce transaction
costs and ease the process of communication between Ethereum and Bittensor. Importantly, this system is not entirely trustless.

#### Minting

The minting price is 1 wTAO.

# DISCLAIMERS
